# <h1 align="center">Mosaic</h1>

<p align="center">
Group watch nights should be fun ‚Äì not an hour-long debate about what to watch.
<p>
<p align="center">
Mosaic is a mobile app that takes the guesswork out of group entertainment. Instead of endlessly scrolling or settling for whatever‚Äôs ‚Äúokay,‚Äù Mosaic uses AI-driven mood inputs, collaborative filtering, and short, curated video clips to help groups find the perfect thing to watch fast! Each person bookmarks what catches their eye, and over time, Mosaic uses advanced machine learning to understand your group‚Äôs evolving tastes, preferences, and viewing dynamics. It suggests titles that match the mood, not just the genre. Whether you're in the mood for something light and funny or emotionally intense, Mosaic will make deciding what to watch as enjoyable as watching itself.
</p>
<br>

## MVP :trophy:

- User account with secure authentication
- Mood-Based Input
  - Users describe or take a quick quiz about the kind of vibe they‚Äôre in the mood for.
- Taste Refinement
  - Mosaic learns user and group preferences over time through mood inputs, clip bookmarks, and feedback.
- Clip Browsing
  - Watch short, curated, spoiler-free clips and bookmark anything interesting to refine suggestions.
- Personal/Group Recommendation Engine
  - Based on combined preferences, Mosaic suggests a small set of titles tailored to the group‚Äôs current mood.
- Shared Watchlist
  - Groups can bookmark movies/shows to watch later and track what they‚Äôve already seen or skipped.
- Movie Import from other apps (e.g., Letterboxd)
- Basic Filters
  - Filter content by genre, runtime, and available streaming platforms.

  <br> <br>

## Stretch Goals :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- Spoiler Free Clips
  - Automatically identify and extract compelling, spoiler-free scenes from full content.
- Group Analytics Dashboard
  - Visualize patterns like genre leanings, shared mood trends, and content overlap.
- Taste-Stretching Wildcards
  - Suggest high-quality picks that fall slightly outside the group's usual preferences for new discovery.
- Contextual Info Cards
  - View trailers, cast details, ratings, trivia, and related titles from within the app.
- Browser Extension
  - Save scenes, trailers, or YouTube videos to your Mosaic profile from external sites.

## Roadblocks and Possible Solutions :construction: :bulb:

- Either the Frontend or Backend team falling behind.
  - If this happens the best course would be to get some assistance from the other side until caught up
  - Worst case scenario we move on and focus on implementing the important features
- Running into Firebase Tech Stack Issues.
  - If for any reason we are having a hard time with utilizing Firebase in the early stages of development then we immediately switch over to another like MERN, AWS, ‚Ä¶.
- Clip acquisition and processing limitations
  - Begin with licensed trailer content or API-based previews before exploring Spoiler free clip generation

<br>

## Competition :vs:

- TikTok/YouTube Shorts
  - Great for entertainment discovery, but lack group decision-making tools and personalization.
- Netflix
  - Offers trailers and some suggestions, but no collaborative or mood-based recommendation systems.
- JustWatch
  - Focuses on availability across streaming platforms, not preference learning or group interaction.
- Letterboxd
  - Strong in reviews and logging, but lacks real-time, group-based suggestion features.
